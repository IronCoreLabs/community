# The IronCore Community

Our mission is to make the world a safer place to do business online -- for people and for companies. We're doing this by building tools to help people make software (or at least the data it handles) fundamentally more secure against attack and fundamentally more private.  We'd like to invite our users, fans, people thinking about these topics, and people thinking about using IronCore's products to join our community to talk openly (or not, if needed) about what you're building, to solicit help, give advice, ask and answer questions, make feature suggestions and so forth. Please join us and let's make the world a bit better together!

## Join Us

Please join us in one of these two places:

* [The IronCore Github Forum](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/community/discussions) is the best place to ask questions whose answers might be helpful to others, to post feature requests, to report bugs, and to have in-depth discussions on how we tackle the bigger problems. This is a space where interactions may be long-lived.
* [The IronCore Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HMpce3NfQz) is a great place to ask quick questions, share your work and to get to know other IronCore users over asynchronous chat.  This is meant to be a bit less formal.  This is a somewhat ephemeral community space.

## Open source

As part of our mission, we have a strong emphasis on open-source software. Much, but not all, of the IronCore products are released as open source under various licenses. You can [browse our repos](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/) or jump straight to one of interest. Here are some of the noteworthy projects we maintain:

        * [gridiron](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/gridiron) -- constant time big number math library used by recrypt-rs
        * [recrypt](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt) -- proxy re-encryption / transform cryptography library in scala (audited, not constant time)
        * [recrypt-wasm-binding](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-wasm-binding) -- build recrypt-rs for use in browsers
        * [recrypt-node-binding](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-node-binding) -- build recrypt-rs for use in node
    * **High-level crypto libraries (these use recrypt)**
        * [ironoxide](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironoxide) -- rust library for interacting with the proxy re-encryption service
